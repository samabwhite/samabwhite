# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Samuel White

## About Me
I'm an ex-professional archer turned software engineering student @ Arizona State University. I'm passionate about Quantum Computing, Chemical Simulation, AI, and Finance. I'm completely self-taught in quantum computing and dedicate my free time to studying the subject.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python (preferred), Java, C++, C, Javascript, HTML/CSS
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** PyTorch, Qiskit, NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, React, Node.js, Express.js, Redux
- **Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL

## Projects
### [SamGPT.dev](https://www.samgpt.dev)
[![GitHub](https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/30/FFFFFF/github.png)](https://github.com/samabwhite/SamGPT)  
SamGPT is a custom built, locally trained, 10.5M parameter Decoder-Only Transformer (GPT) model integrated into a chatbot web application for real-time text predictions.

#### Features:
- Live GPT model text predictions
- Conversation History
- User Authentication

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pytorch, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB  
**Hosting:** AWS *(Sagemaker + Lambda + API Gateway)*, DigitalOcean

### [Neural Network Framework](https://github.com/samabwhite/NeuralNetworkFramework)
A simple neural network framework based on the Builder Design Pattern, implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy. This framework contains various types of layers, activation functions, and error functions, which makes it easy to build and train neural networks.
#### Features:
- Support for different layer types (Hidden Layer, Activation Layer, Error Layer)
- Multiple activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax, ELU)
- Multiple error functions (Mean Squared Error, Categorical Cross-Entropy, Binary Cross-Entropy, KL Divergence, Cosine Similarity Loss)
- Training with batch processing
