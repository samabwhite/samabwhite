# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Samuel White

## About Me
I'm an ex-professional archer turned software engineering student @ Arizona State University. I'm passionate about Quantum Computing, AI, and Finance. I'm completely self-taught in quantum computing and dedicate my free time to studying the subject.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python (preferred), Qiskit, Java, C++, C

## Projects
### Quantum Algorithms Implementation
I enjoy learning about quantum algorithms, and some of my current projects include:
- **Multi-Controlled-X Gate Decomposition:** [Check it out here](https://github.com/samabwhite/QOSF-Cohort-8-Screening-Task)
- **Grover Search Algorithm:** [Check it out here](https://github.com/samabwhite/Grover-Search-Implementation)
- **Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm:** [Check it out here](https://github.com/samabwhite/Deutsch-Jozsa-Implementation)
### Neural Network Framework
I previously attempted my own version of a neural network framework similar to Tensorflow and PyTorch:
- **Neural Network FrameWork *(in progress)*:** [Check it out here](https://github.com/samabwhite/NeuralNetworkFramework)
